## What is Blurry?

Blurry is a Chrome Extension that allows you to _BLUR_ the contents on any webpage before do your things! The blur level can be customized and the setting will be saved across all active tabs. It also allows you to blur only the piece of content that you don't need it to show.

### _How would you do when you don't want the blur anymore?_ 🤔

💡 Do not worry, it has an option for that, one click and all blurry masks will be removed from the webpage.

### Privacy, Privacy, Privacy _Does Blurry collect/modify the original content?

We understand _privacy is important to everyone and we do respect that._ We **DO NOT** collect/modify or do anything on the original content. You can imagine Blurry is like a _blur filter_ on top of the content, which you can choose where to put it on.

### _Doesn't it sound simple and make your life easier?_

Please try it out and tell us how you feel 😉
