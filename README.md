# Blurry
Blurry - Blur unwanted contents on any webpage with the customized blur level

Have you ever wanted to blur or delete any content on a webpage before sharing it with friends?

Have you ever felt tired of downloading and blurring some privacy content before printing from the webpage?

Have you ever ...

Blurry is the Chrome Extension that allows you to _BLUR_ the contents on any webpage before do your things! The blur level can be customized and the setting will be saved across all active tabs. It also allows you to blur only the piece of content that you don't need it to show.

How would you do when you don't want the blur anymore? Do not worry, it has an option for that, one click and all blurry masks will be removed from the webpage.

Doesn't it sound simple and make your life easier?

Please try it out and tell us how you feel 😉
